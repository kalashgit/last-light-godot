# LAST LIGHT — Mesh Sprint v0.1

**Status: executable technical candidate factory, not visual/Golden production approval.**

A CPU-first Python compiler for versioned, original, parameterized 3D game asset recipes. It uses NumPy for geometry and Trimesh to export self-contained `.glb` files. **No paid API, cloud GPU, Blender process, online references, or AI call is made per asset.** Optional Blender rendering and F11/F12 review belong to the existing specialized downstream Foundry tools.

## Install and run

```bash
python -m pip install -r tools/mesh_sprint/requirements.txt
python tools/mesh_sprint/factory.py --demo 24 --out output/quick --workers 2
python tools/mesh_sprint/verify.py --root output/quick
python tools/mesh_sprint/factory.py --demo 2000 --out output/benchmark --workers 4
python tools/mesh_sprint/factory.py --input tools/mesh_sprint/examples/catalog_example.csv --out output/real --workers 4
pytest -q tests/test_factory.py tests/test_verify.py
```

`--demo N` creates **N deterministic synthetic geometry variants**, NOT N distinct catalog object designs and NOT N founder-approved game assets. This is a speed and structural regression, not a content-production claim. Every GLB/JSON sidecar is written atomically, and a rerun skips entries only if both the recipe hash and output SHA-256 match. Repaired corrupted outputs rebuild. Duplicate asset IDs reject before processing. Invalid/unsupported families fail closed rather than being misrepresented as the named item.

## Current benchmark, measured on the assistant's container

- Hardware: isolated 5-logical-CPU environment; 4 worker processes; Python 3.13, NumPy and Trimesh 4.11.1.
- Fresh synthetic run: **2,000 candidate GLBs in 2.1284 seconds**, zero compiler failures; **2,000 unique GLB hashes** after fixing the initial duplicated-geometry defect.
- This satisfies the **synthetic compiler throughput** target of 2,000 outputs in 900 seconds on the benchmark environment. The 15-minute claim does **not** yet cover 2,000 item-specific detailed recipes, QA renders, human visual approvals, texture baking, collision authoring, 16-direction animation, Godot game integration, or asset sourcing.
- Geometry uniqueness is derived from deterministic shape/profile transforms. It is **not the same as 2,000 independent semantic game items**. Only 12 authored families are implemented.

See `report.json` from the selected run. Performance varies with mesh complexity, storage, material count, machine, and downstream QA.

## Canonical input

CSV, JSONL or JSON list. One record = one asset. Required: `asset_id`, plus `family` from 12 supported families or explicit `parts` JSON geometry recipe. Optional: `seed`, `variant`, `recipe_version`, `source_reference`.

Supported families: `avocado`, `backpack`, `axe`, `armor`, `shelf`, `bottle`, `barrel`, `crate`, `helmet`, `medkit`, `chair`, `canister`.

The `parts` mode supports **five operators**: `box` (`location`, `dimensions`), `ellipsoid` (`location`, `radii`, optional `boxiness`), `lathe` (`profile` as `[z,r]` rings), `tube` (`points`, `radius`), and `polygon_prism` (`outline_xz`, `depth`). Every part also declares a material key. Validate the geometry visually before promoting. **This is a minimal independent recipe interface, not a blanket claim of compatibility with the existing Drive V2 schema.** A schema adapter and further geometry operators are required.

A complete example is in `tools/mesh_sprint/examples/custom_recipe.jsonl`. No unapproved name-only fallback or guessed category mapping is permitted for the 4,347 master-catalog rows.

## Outputs and safeguards

- `models/{asset_id}.glb` — actual 3D scene geometry and material vertex colors.
- `metadata/{asset_id}.json` — digest, geometry metrics, recipe version, provenance, candidate status.
- `manifest.jsonl`, `report.json`, `failures.jsonl` — export log and truthful coverage counts.
- `verify.py` — independent import/geometry/collision-free structural checks; not a visual evaluator.

Asset status: `generated_candidate`, `golden_approved=false`, `identity_verified=false`. Empty storage props are empty. Do not copy or trace Project Zomboid visual assets. Source references are research/provenance, not a license to redistribute their artwork.

## Development roadmap to genuine 4,347 catalog assets

1. **Recipe intake:** Map the master catalog to canonical IDs, reference images and original identity evidence. Parse/validate the Drive recipe V2 schema and reject missing/unknown geometries; prefer family-specific construction recipes.
2. **Geometry execution:** Add spline/sweep, bevels, sewn fabric, tapered surfaces, knife/axe-head edge contours, strap seams, hollow interiors, functional hinges and modular armor shaping. Avoid generic box approximations for objects such as backpacks.
3. **Closed-loop QA:** Render fixed 8/16 headings in persistent Blender workers; compare outlines and material regions against independently authorized design briefs, flag identity failures, revise *only* failing components. Keep author approvals separate.
4. **Throughput gate:** Benchmark *2,000 different catalog recipes*, including staging, GLB export, technical QA, thumbnails, and manifest packaging, on the intended hardware. Report p50/p95 latency, peak RSS, unique identifiers, failure rate, true end-to-end wall time.
5. **Gameplay gate:** Export anchored Godot 2:1 isometric sprites, materials, mesh scaling/collisions and held/world variants; validate in a real Godot runtime and iPhone Xogot. Existing `main.tscn` and saved gameplay remain untouched until founder review.

## Integration

This feature is deliberately isolated under `tools/mesh_sprint/`. It neither changes `main.tscn` nor takes over the existing `tools/foundry_mass/` and `tools/foundry_creation/` pipelines. The user must explicitly approve any promotion, gameplay integration or merge.
